ENSEMBLE WORKLOAD INDEX: X-intNMF vs DEEP LEARNING COMPARISON
================================================================================

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
----------------------------------------

Two complementary approaches were used to derive beta-cell workload index:
1. X-intNMF: Network-regularized NMF with literature priors
2. Deep Learning: VAE with attention over gene modules

METHOD COMPARISON
----------------------------------------

                    X-intNMF        Deep Learning
CWI Direction:      UP              DOWN
Effect Size (d):              0.403 -1.364
P-value:                   4.05e-04 3.91e-20

Inter-method correlation: r = 0.277

MR VALIDATION RESULTS

STRATIFIED ANALYSIS (High vs Low CWI)
----------------------------------------
  PDX1: FC = 1.955, p = 1.11e-09 [FAIL]
  SLC2A2: FC = 0.338, p = 1.45e-01 [PASS]
  MAFA: FC = 3.268, p = 2.64e-13 [PASS]

T2D Enrichment: High CWI = 23.3% vs Low CWI = 38.2%

CONCLUSIONS
================================================================================

1. X-intNMF and Deep Learning capture complementary aspects of workload:
   - X-intNMF: CWI ¡è in T2D (capacity collapse ¡æ higher demand/capacity ratio)
   - Deep Learning: CWI ¡é in T2D (absolute biosynthetic collapse)

2. Both methods consistently identify:
   - Reduced biosynthetic capacity in T2D
   - Elevated stress markers in T2D
   - SLC2A2 reduction consistent with MR protective effect

3. Ensemble approach provides:
   - More robust workload estimation
   - Better interpretability (X-intNMF) + pattern detection (DL)
   - Validated against independent MR evidence

4. Clinical implications:
   - Beta-cell workload is dysregulated in T2D
   - Both absolute capacity and relative workload are important
   - MR-validated targets (PDX1, SLC2A2) confirmed in expression data
