## After Beta-Cell Workload Project

**Next Focus: Aging Research**

Connection points from current project:
- Workload framework applicable to aging cells
- Cellular senescence and metabolic stress overlap
- Beta-cell aging contributes to T2D progression
- X-intNMF and ensemble methods transferable

Potential directions:
- Apply workload index to aging beta-cells (Enge dataset already available)
- Connect workload states to senescence markers
- Longevity intervention effects on cellular workload
- Cross-tissue aging workload comparisons
